# Focusly - A Simple macOS Menu Bar Pomodoro Timer

**Focusly** is a minimalist macOS menu bar application designed to help you manage your focus and break sessions, inspired by techniques like the Pomodoro Technique. It lives quietly in your menu bar, providing quick access to your timer without cluttering your dock or desktop.
